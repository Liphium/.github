## Hi there, we're Liphium 👋

Liphium is a decentralized chat app where the goal is to make it so that literally everyone can use it for their communication needs. It should be a platform for both your family and also your friends. There are also other projects we maintain under the Liphium name, but for now the chat app is the most important one. 1.0.0 has just been added to [the roadmap](https://liphium.com/docs/general/roadmap/). If you're interested in Liphium, you might want to take a look.

For most of Liphium, it's just me (Julian/Unbreathable) right now, but that still doesn't change the fact that I want to make a decentralized chat app that doesn't suck. I've been working on this project for over 2 years now and if you like this project you can support me at: https://ko-fi.com/liphium.

If we reach the current donation goal, publishing to the App Store especially will be a lot easier as I'm still a student and can't afford real investments into this project except for eating some monthly costs for the staging environment.
