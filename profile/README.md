## Hi there, we're Liphium 👋

For most of Liphium, it's just me (Julian/Unbreathable) right now, but that still doesn't change the fact that I want to make a decentralized chat app that doesn't suck. I've been working on this project for over 2 years now and if you like this project you can support me at: https://ko-fi.com/liphium.
